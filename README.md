# Augmented_Dickey-Fuller_test_for_mean_reversion
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is a statistical test carried out on stocks (and other financial instruments) to test for mean reversion. It forms the basis for a host of 
trading strategies. For instance; if XYZ stocks tests positive for mean reversion we can deploy bollinger bands and set pending market orders that leverage on extreme price levels
knowing that it will reverse back to that mean price.
